## Overview
Recent advances of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have led
extensive study on cellular heterogeneity and cell-to-cell variation. However, the high
frequency of dropout events and noise in scRNA-seq data confound the accuracy of the
downstream analysis, i.e., clustering analysis, whose accuracy depends heavily on the
selected feature genes.Here, by deriving entropy decomposition formula, we proposed a feature selection
method, intrinsic entropy (IE) model, to identify the informative genes for accurately
clustering analysis

## Installation Guide
**Installing dependency package**  
Before installing IEntropy, the “rsvd” package should be installed first:
```
install.packages("rsvd")
```
**Installing IEntropy**  
To install IEntropy, run:
```
```
